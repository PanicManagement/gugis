gugis [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukaszbudnik/gugis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukaszbudnik/gugis)
==============================

Lightweight and robust framework for creating composite components using Guice.

Gugis allows you to bind multiple implementation of the same interface to a composite component. When a call to composite component is being made, gugis automatically calls all found matching implementations. Gugis differentiates two types of implementations: primary and secondary. A typical use case would be disaster recovery where write operations (create, update, delete) would be routed to all implementations, some operations would be routed to only primaries, some to secondaries, etc. See usage for more information.

# Usage

Let's assume we have a `StorageService` interface. It has two implementations `StorageService1Impl` and `StorageService2Impl`. Let's pretend that the first implementation uses Amazon S3 and the second one uses HP Blobstore. 

## Primary and secondary

We want to differentiate between those two implementations. gugis comes with `@Primary` and `@Secondary` annotations so that we can differentiate our implementations or theirs roles.

We can tell gugis to automatically replicate some operations to both primaries and secondaries, some operations to just primaries, some to just secondaries, and some literally to any implementation.

## Composite component

The last step is to create a composite component. For this we need to create another implementation of `StorageService` interface and mark it with `@Composite` annotation. This implementation can have all methods' bodies empty - those methods will never be called. Instead gugis will intercept all calls and route them to proper implementation(s).

How gugis knows what method calls should be routed to what component(s)? Each method we want to be intercepted and routed needs to be marked with `@Replicate` annotation. This annotation has one parameter which can control propagation behaviour. Currently the following propagation bahaviour is supported:

* `@Replicate(propagation = Propagation.ALL)` - method call will be routed to all primaries and all secondaries
* `@Replicate(propagation = Propagation.PRIMARY)` - method call will be routed to all primaries
* `@Replicate(propagation = Propagation.SECONDARY)` - method call will be routed to all secondaries
* `@Replicate(propagation = Propagation.ANY)` - method call will be routed to the very first binding found by Guice, either primary or secondary

## Setup

gugis automatically scans classpath for classes marked with `@Composite`. Autodiscovery can be disabled by setting annotation's autodiscovery parameter to false. See unit tests for how to disable autodiscovery and use manual discovery instead.

# Example

See `src/test/java` for lots of unit tests and examples.

# Download

Use the following Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
